# ClassLift Business Rules

This file is the concise, canonical record of business rules confirmed by the product owner. It supports implementation decisions and will be the source for a future user manual.

## Courses and pricing

1. A course with a Session Count uses fixed per-session pricing.
   - Hourly Cost must be cleared, stored as null, and disabled on the Add Course form.
   - Session Cost is required.
2. A private course without a Session Count uses hourly pricing and requires Credit Tracking.
3. A Group course requires a Session Count and Session Cost.
4. Max Capacity is optional for a Group course. When supplied, it limits active registrations.

## Group-course registration

1. A newly created Group-course registration remains pending until it is confirmed.
2. If the root registration is still unconfirmed when the first Group session starts:
   - cancel the root registration;
   - cancel all of its non-terminal child-session registrations;
   - preserve Completed and Deleted session history; and
   - recalculate course availability when Max Capacity is configured.

## Course completion and reporting

1. Fixed-session Group and private sessions are completed automatically after their scheduled end time.
2. Private sessions without a fixed Session Count are completed manually by the coach using actual hours.
3. Standard course reports include completed child sessions that have Actual Hours recorded.

## Open questions

- Should the unconfirmed Group-registration deadline be the beginning of the first session's local calendar day, or the exact scheduled start time? The current implementation uses the exact scheduled start time.
